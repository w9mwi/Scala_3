FUNCTIONAL PROGRAM MODELING
===========================

When you write a Scala program using the Functional Programing Paradigm
(instead of the Object-Oriented Paradigm), the program is typically
modeled using these Scala constructs:

* Enumerations
* Case classes
* Traits

With Functional Programming, the data, and the operations on that data, are
separated.  You donâ€™t encapsulate them together in a single class, as you
would with Object-Oriented Programming.  For example, a set of numbers (which
is the data), and the operations performed on those numbers (which is the
behavior) should be separated from each other in a program that implements
functional programming.
