FUNCTIONAL PROGRAM MODELING
===========================

When you write a Scala program using the Functional Programing Paradigm
(instead of the Object-Oriented Paradigm), the program is typically
modeled using these Scala constructs:

* Enumerations
* Case classes
* Traits

With Functional Programming, the data, and the operations on that data, are
two separate things.  You donâ€™t encapsulate them together in a single class,
as you would with Object-Oriented Programming.  Consider, for example, a set
of numbers (which is the data), and the operations performed on those numbers
(which is the behavior).  Separating the data (numbers) from the operations
performed on those numbers is how you'd code a functional program.
