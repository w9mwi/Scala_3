In Scala 3 the '|' character can be an operator, dependent on the
data types that surround it.  For example, '|' is bitwise or operator
if the data types surounding it reference a number, a char, or a
Boolean value.

If the '|' operator is surrounded by a data type reference (i.e.,
Int, Boolean, Float, etc.) it becomes a union operator.

val things: List[String | Int | Double] = List(1, "two", 3.0) // with union types
