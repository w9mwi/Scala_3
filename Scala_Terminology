Expression - An Expression is a line of code that returns a value; such as a String,
             an Array[Double], an Int, a List[String], etc.  When all lines of code
             in a program return a value, that program qualifies to be called:

             Expression-Oriented Programming = EOP 


Statement - A Statement is a line of code that doesn't return a value.  Examples of
            a statement are lines of code that print data to the screen, read data
            from a file, write data to a file, delete data from a file.  An if/else
            in Scala can be written so it always return a value, and therefore
            qualifies as an expression.  An if/else can also be written so it
            doesn't return a value, so it's just a statement.
