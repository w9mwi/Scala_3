============================
Most class definitions are written to have a single default constructor.
But you can define a class that contains multiple constructors, so a
new class can be instantiated using different different argument lists.
Tese additional constructors are called Auxiliary Constructors.  The
following program demonstrates a class definition having Auxiliary
Class Constructors.
