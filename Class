AUXILIARY CLASS CONSTRUCTORS
============================
Most class definitions are written to have a single constructor, which
is known as the class's Primary Constructor.  However, you can define
a class that contains multiple constructors; so that class can be
instantiated using different argument lists.  These additional
constructors are called Auxiliary Constructors.  The following program
demonstrates a class definition that has two Auxiliary Class Constructors.

IMPORTANT: The first line of code executed by an Auxiliary Constructor
           MUST be a call to "this", which invokes the class's Primary
           Constructor.
