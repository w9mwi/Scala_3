AUXILIARY CLASS CONSTRUCTORS
============================
Most class definitions are written to have a single constructor, which
is known as the class's Primary Constructor.  However, you can define
a class that contains multiple constructors; so that class can be
instantiated using different argument lists.  These additional
constructors are called Auxiliary Constructors.

IMPORTANT: The first line of code executed by an Auxiliary Constructor
           MUST be a call to "this", which invokes the class's Primary
           Constructor.  So every time an Auxiliary Constructor is
           invoked, the first thing it must do is invoke the class's
           Primary Constructor.

import java.time.*

class Student(name:String, govtId:Int):
  // PRIMARY CONSTRUCTOR
  // Code at this indentation level will get executed once (and
  // only once) every time a new Student class is instantiated;
  // regardless of which constructors are invoked.
  print(s"\nname = $name, govtId = $govtId")

  // AUXILIARY CONSTRUCTOR #1
  def this(name:String, govtId:Int, applicationDate:LocalDate) =
    this(name, govtId) // Calling "this" invokes the Student class Primary Constructor.
    print(s", applicationDate = $applicationDate")

  // AUXILIARY CONSTRUCTOR #2
  def this(name:String, govtId:Int, studentId:Int) =
    this(name, govtId) // Calling "this" invokes the Student class Primary Constructor.
    print(s", studentId = $studentId")

/******************
 * main()
 *****************/
@main def main() =
  // The following line of code invokes ONLY the Primary Constructor.
  val stud1 = Student("Joe", 111)
  // PRINTS: name = Joe, govtId = 111

  // The following line invokes the Primary Constructor and Auxiliary Constructor #1.
  val stud2 = Student("Jane", 222, LocalDate.now());
  // PRINTS: name = Jane, govtId = 222, applicationDate = 2024-12-06

  // The following line invokes the Primary Constructor and Auxiliary Constructor #2.
  val stud3 = Student("Alice", 333, 444)
  // PRINTS: name = Alice, govtId = 333, studentId = 444
