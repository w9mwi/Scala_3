The Scala 3 main() program below demonstrates how to use the following
Scala 3 control structures...

* if/else
* for loops and expressions
* match expressions
* while loops
* try/catch

In Scala 3, the do-while loop has been removed.  The "do" keyword
can now be used in the for loop, and in the while loop but AFTER
the while statement, instead of BEFORE the while loop as in Scala 2.
