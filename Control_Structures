The Scala 3 main() program below demonstrates how to use the following
Scala 3 control structures...

* if/else
* for loops and expressions
* match expressions
* while loops
* try/catch

In Scala 3 the do-while loop has been removed.  The "do" keyword can
can now be used in the for loop.  In Scala 3 the "do" keyword is used
in the while loop AFTER the while statement, instead of BEFORE the
while loop as in Scala 2.

Control statements in Scala 3 don't require parenthesis () or braces {}
as they do in Scala 2.  They are optional in Scala 3.
