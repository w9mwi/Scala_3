In Scala 3 'enum' and 'type' are keywords.  There is no keyword used to declare
or reference a tuple.

In Scala, a val can be declared a "tuple."  A tuple is a value that actually
contains multiple values, where each value it contains can be of any data type.
You can declare a val to be a tuple.  A tuple can be passed to a method as a
single argument.  A method can also return a tuple.
