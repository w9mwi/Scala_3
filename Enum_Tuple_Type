In Scala 3 'enum' and 'type' are keywords.  There is no keyword used to declare
or reference a tuple.


TUPLES
======
A tuple is a single value that contains multiple values; where each
value it contains can be of any data type; including other tuples
and collections like Array, List, etc.

You can declare a val to be a tuple.  A tuple can be passed to a method as an
argument (one argument per tuple).  When a method needs to return multiple
values, it must return a tuple.
