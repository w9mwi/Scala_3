SBT = SCALA BUILD TOOL
======================

SBT (Scala Build Tool) is an application that launches an "SBT server".
Once you launch SBT, an SBT prompt appears.  From the SBT prompt, you
can compile code, build projects, and execute the compiled code.

You must first install SBT, which is not covered in this documentation.

The following instructions show how to use SBT to compile and run
a simple Scala program.

CREATE A DIRECTORY
==================
Create a new directory that will contain your SBT project.  The name you
give to this directory will be the name of your SBT project, and will
appear as part of the SBT prompt after you launch the SBT server.

$ mkdir sbt  (Create a directory named "sbt".)
$ cd sbt     (Point to the sbt directory.)

From this point on, you will always be working from this "sbt" directory.


CREATE AN EMPTY SBT BUILD FILE
==============================
You need a file named sbt.build to launch the SBT server.  A build.sbt
file can be empty, but it must exist!  In this example, create an empty
build.sbt file by running the following Linux command.  Later on, we'll
add text to this build.sbt file.

$ touch build.sbt   (Create a new, empty, build.sbt file.)

CREATE A FILE NAMED Main.scala
==============================
In the same directory that contains your sbt.build file, create the following
nested directories.  The Main.Scala file (shown below) will reside in the
src/main/scala/example directory create with the following mkdir command.

$ mkdir -p src/main/scala/example

In the src/main/scala/example directory, create a file named Main.scala,
then copy and paste the following Scala code into it.

====================================
package example  // This Main.scala file is located in "example" directory.

// This is a Scala 2 program, which also works in Scala 3.
object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("Scala 2 - Hello World")
  }
}

/**********
// This commented out code is a Scala 3 program used for a later demo.
@main def main(): Unit =
  println("Scala 3 - Hello World")
  println(s"Scala version: ${scala.util.Properties.versionNumberString}")
end main
**********/
====================================

LAUNCH SBT SERVER
=================
Launch the SBT server, and the following SBT prompt appears.

$ sbt
sbt:sbt>    (To exit SBT, enter "exit" from the SBT prompt.)

Once you're at the SBT prompt, you can obtain SBT help via
the "help" command, like the following example shows.

sbt:sbt> help      (Prints info for how to obtain SBT help.)
sbt:sbt> help run  (Prints help for the SBT run command.)

The following command prints to the console the Scala version currently
used by your SBT project.

sbt:sbt> scalaVersion

To change the Scala version used by your SBT project, run the following command
from the SBT prompt.  If you don't run it, the default Scala version will be used.

sbt:sbt> set ThisBuild / scalaVersion := "2.13.12"

COMPILE THE SCALA PROGRAM
=========================
To compile the SBT project, you have these 2 options:

1)  The following command performs a single manual compile,
    and returns you to the SBT prompt.

    sbt:sbt> compile

2)  The following "~compile" command performs a compile just like the
    above "compile" command, but it doesn't return to the SBT prompt!

    Instead, the "~compile" command remains "up-and-running", waiting for
    changes to be made to SBT project files.  For example, if you make a
    change to your Main.Scala file, and then save the change, Main.scala
    will be immediately recompiled.  This prevents you from having to
    manually run "compile" every time a file is changed.

    sbt:sbt> ~compile

RUN THE SCALA PROGRAM FROM SBT
==============================
After you've successfully compiled your Scala program,
you can execute it via SBT like this:

$ run

The following text is printed to the console, and you're returned to the SBT prompt.
Scala 2 - Hello World
sbt:sbt>
