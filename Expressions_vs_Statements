Expression - A line of code that returns a value, i.e., String, Array, Int, List, etc.
             When a line of code returns a value, that is known as "expression-oriented
             programming", abbreviated EOP.

Statement - A line of code that doesn't return a value.  Examples of this are print
           statements, reading, writing, or deleting data from a file.
