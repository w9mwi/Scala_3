Expression - A line of code that returns a value such as a String, an Array, an Int, a List, etc.
             When a line of code returns a value, that's known as "expression-oriented programming",
             abbreviated EOP.

Statement - A line of code that doesn't return a value.  Examples of this are print
            statements, reading, writing, or deleting data from a file.  if/else
            statements can be written so they always return a value; they can also
            be written so they don't return a value.
