METHODS AND FUNCTIONS
=====================

In Scala 2 and Scala 3 a method can be defined inside a...

* class
* case class
* object
* case object
* trait

In Scala 3 a method can also be defined outside any of those constructs,
as a stand-alone method.  These methods are known as "top-level"
definitions because they're not nested within another definition.
In other words, methods in Scala 3 can be defined anywhere.

In Scala 3 the last line of a method definition can include the new
Scala 3 soft keyword "end" followed by the method name.  This makes
it easier to see exactly where a method definition ends, and is optional.
Below is an example of program using two stand-alone methods.

def greetingWithName(name:String):String =
  s"Hey, my name is $name."
end greetingWithName  // This line works only with Scala 3, and is optional.

@main def main() =
  println(greetingWithName("Sally")) // PRINTS: Hey, my name is Sally.
  println(greetingWithWeight(478))   // PRINTS: Hey, I weigh 478 pounds.
  def greetingWithWeight(weight:Int):String =
    s"Hey, I weigh $weight pounds."
  end greetingWithWeight // This line works only with Scala 3, and is optional.
