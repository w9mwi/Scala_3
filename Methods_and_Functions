METHODS AND FUNCTIONS
=====================

In Scala 2 and Scala 3 a method can be defined...

* Inside a class
* Inside a case class
* Inside an object
* Inside a case object
* Inside a trait

In Scala 3 a method can be defined outside any of those constructs,
as a stand-alone method.  These methods are known as "top-level"
definitions because they're not nested in another definition.  In
other words, methods in Scala 3 can be defined anywhere.  Here is
an example of two stand-alone methods...

def greetingWithName(name:String):String =
  s"Hey, my name is $name."

@main def main() =
  println(greetingWithName("Sally")) // PRINTS: Hey, my name is Sally.
  println(greetingWithWeight(478))   // PRINTS: Hey, I weigh 478 pounds.
  def greetingWithWeight(weight:Int):String =
    s"Hey, I weigh $weight pounds."
