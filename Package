The following two packages are implicitly imported into the scope of all Scala source code files.

1) java.lang.*
2) scala.*

MENTION HOW TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS BETWEEN PACKAGES, like List in both Java and Scala.

By convention, Scala package names should be all lower case.
The formal naming convention is:

<top-level-domain>.<domain-name>.<project-name>.<module-name>...

For example:  package io.github.w9mwi.Demo

Although itâ€™s not required, package names typically follow directory structure
names.  Following this convention, a Person class in a Scala project could be
found in this directory:  io/github/w9mwi/myapp/Person.scala
