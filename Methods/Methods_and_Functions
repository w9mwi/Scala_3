METHODS AND FUNCTIONS
=====================

In Scala 2 and Scala 3 methods can be defined...

* Inside a class
* Inside a case class
* Inside an object
* Inside a trait


In Scala 3 methods can also be defined outside any of those constructs,
as stand-alone methods.  Such methods are called “top-level” definitions,
since they're not nested in another definition.  So in Scala 3 a method
be defined anywhere.  Here's an example.
