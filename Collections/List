SCALA LIST COLLECTION
=====================
A Scala List cannot be altered/changed after it's been created.  If you want to
"change" a Scala List, you actually need to create a new List.  The following
program demostrates how to do that.

A Scala List is a linked-list.  Generally, you shouldnâ€™t access elements
of a large list via an index value.  Like this, for example...

   myList(999999)

Accessing a List element via an index can take a long time because all elements in
the List (up to the index value) must first be traversed.  If you have a large collection
and want to access its elements via an index, you should use a Vector or an ArrayBuffer
collection instead of a List.

The following link contains a summary of some commonly-used Scala collections.

The following program demonstrates how to do the following:

  1) Update a single element in a List.
  2) Append/Prepend a single element to a List.
  3) Concatenate (append or prepend) a List to a List.

@main def main() =
  var intList:List[Int] = List(-666, 2, 3)
  println(s"1) intList = $intList") // PRINTS: intList = List(-666, 2, 3)

  // To "UPDATE" ONE ELEMENT of a List, call the List.updated method.
  // Because a List is immutable, this actually returns a new List.
  intList = intList.updated(0, 1) // 0 = the List index, 1 = the value
  println(s"2) intList = $intList") // PRINTS: intList = List(1, 2, 3)

  // To PREPEND ONE ELEMENT to a List, use the :: operator, or the +: operator.
  // The :: operator is called the "cons" operator; short for the word "construct."
  // The +: operator is known as the "list prepend operator."
  // Both these operators return a new List.
  intList = 0 :: intList
  println(s"3) intList = $intList") // PRINTS: intList = List(0, 1, 2, 3)
  intList = -1 +: intList
  println(s"4) intList = $intList") // PRINTS: intList = List(-1, 0, 1, 2, 3)

  // To APPEND ONE ELEMENT to a List, use the :+ operator.
  // The :+ operator is known as the "list append operator."
  // This returns a new List.
  intList = intList :+ 4
  println(s"5) intList = $intList") // PRINTS: intList = List(-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

  // To CONCAT A LIST to a List, use the ::: operator.  The ::: operator is
  // known as the "list concatenation operator."  This returns a new List.
  intList = List(-4, -3, -2) ::: intList ::: List(5, 6, 7)
  println(s"6) intList = $intList") // PRINTS: intList = List(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
