Scala 3 contains a Range class and a NumericRange class.  The Range class
works exclusively with Int values.  The NumericRange class is more generic,
as it works with other numeric types like Char, Long, BigInt, and BigDecimal.

When you need a range that works with Int values, use the Range class.
When you need a range that works with non-Int numeric types, use the NumericRange class.
