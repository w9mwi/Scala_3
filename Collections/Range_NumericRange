Scala 3 contains a Range class and a NumericRange class.  The Range class
works exclusively with Int values.  The NumericRange class works with
other numeric types like Long, BigInt, and BigDecimal.

When you need a range that works with Int values, use the Range class.
When you need a range that works with non-Int numeric types, use the NumericRange class.


@main def main():Unit =
  // A Range specified with the word 'until' has a data type of
  // Range; which doesn't include the value appearing after the
  // word 'until'.
  var myRange_1:Range = 1 until 5
  myRange_1.foreach {
    x => print(x + ", ")  // PRINTS: 1, 2, 3, 4,
  }
  println
  // A Range specified with the word 'to' has a data type of
  // Range.Inclusive; which includes the value appearing after
  // the word 'to'.
  var myRange_2:Range.Inclusive = 1 to 5
  myRange_2.foreach {
    x => print(x + ", ") // PRINTS: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
  }

end main
