VECTOR
======
The elements of an Array class are mutable.  Elements of the Vector class are
immutable.  So once a Vector is initialized, you can't change any of its elements.
A Vector inherits from the IndexedSeq trait, which means that accessing any of its
elements via an index is fast and efficient.

Use a Vector (instead of an Array) when you want an immutable collection that
can be accessed fast and efficiently via an index.

The following program demonstrates how various ArrayBuffer operators
and ArrayBuffer methods work.
