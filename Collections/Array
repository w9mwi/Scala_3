ARRAY
=====

The Scala 3 Array class is mutable.  Scala 3 also contains an
immutable array object (not a class) with the name IArray.

If you need a mutable array, use the Array class.
If you need an immutable array, use the IArray object.

Difference Between Array and ArrayBuffer
========================================
A Scala Array is a fixed-size array.  Once an Array is created, its
size (the number of elements it contains) cannot be changed.  The Scala
ArrayBuffer is variable in size; so even after it's created, you can
increase or decrease its size (the number of elements it contains)
dynamically.

In Scala, Arrays are SEQUENCES, which means data is stored in elements
that can be accessed via a sequential Integer index.  When an Array is
declared as a "val" you can't reassign that "val" to points to a
different Array, but you can reassign its elements to store different
values.  Unlike many Scala collections, an Array can't be declared as
immutable.  If you need an immutable Array, use the IArray object instead
of the Array class.
