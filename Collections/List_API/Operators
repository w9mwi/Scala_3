LIST OPERATORS
==============

All Scala operators are actually Scala methods.  Many of the operators
that work on the Scala List class also work on other Scala collections
(i.e, Vectors, ArrayBuffers, ListBuffers, etc.) in a similar way.  Once
you understand how these operators work on a List class, you'll understand
how they work on other collection classes.

The following five operators work on the Scala 3 List class.

1) ::   Constructs a List.  Often called the "cons" operator.  Use it to
        prepend one or more elements to a List.  The right-most operand
        must evaluate to a List.  All other operands must evaluate to
        a value.

        NOTE: The :: and +: operators can be used interchangeably, as they return
              the same result.  The :: operator works only on a List collection.
              The +: operator works on any Scala collection of type IterableOnce.
              When working with Lists, use the :: operator because it's commonly
              used in recursive functions and for pattern matching (head :: tail).

        @main def main():Unit =
          var intList:List[Int] = 333 :: List(444, 555)
          println(s"intList = $intList")  // PRINTS: intList = List(333, 444, 555)
          intList = 111 :: 222 :: intList
          println(s"intList = $intList")  // PRINTS: intList = List(111, 222, 333, 444, 555)
        end main

2) :::  Concatenates two Lists.  Works only on the List class.  Has the same
        functionality as the ++ operator.

3) ++   Concatenates two Lists.
        This operator concatenates two Scala collections of the same type, that
        inherit from type Seq.  Therefore, it works with many Scala collections,
        including the List class.

        @main def main():Unit =
          var intList:List[Int] = List(333, 444)
          // Use the ::: operator to concat two Lists...
          intList = intList ::: List(555, 666)
          println(s"intList = $intList")  // PRINTS: intList = List(333, 444, 555, 666)
          // Use the ++ operator to concat two Lists...
          intList = List(111, 222) ++ intList
          println(s"intList = $intList")  // PRINTS: intList = List(111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666)
        end main


4) +:	Prepends one or more elements to a List.  The right-most operand must
        evaluate to a List.  All other operands must evaluate to a value.

        NOTE: The +: and :: operators can be used interchangeably, as they return
              the same result.  The :: operator works only on a List collection.
              The +: operator works on any Scala collection of type IterableOnce.
              When working with Lists, use the :: operator because it's commonly
              used in recursive functions and for pattern matching (head :: tail).

        @main def main():Unit =
          var intList:List[Int] = List(444, 555)
          intList = 333 +: intList
          println(s"intList = $intList") // PRINTS: intList = List(333, 444, 555, 666)
          intList = 111 +: 222 +: intList
          println(s"intList = $intList") // PRINTS: intList = List(111, 222, 333, 444, 555)
        end main

5) :+   Appends one or more elements to a List.  The left-most operand must evaluate to
        a List.  All other operands must evaluate to a value. This is an O(n) operation
        (the larger the List, the less efficient it becomes).  Avoid using the :+ operator
        on large lists.

        @main def main():Unit =
          var intList:List[Int] = List(111, 222)
          intList = intList :+ 333
          println(s"intList = $intList") // PRINTS: intList = List(111, 222, 333)
          intList = intList :+ 444 :+ 555
          println(s"intList = $intList") // PRINTS: intList = List(111, 222, 333, 444, 555)
       end main
