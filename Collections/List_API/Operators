LIST OPERATORS
==============

Many of the operators that work on the Scala List class also work on other
Scala collections (i.e, Vectors, ArrayBuffers, ListBuffers, etc.) in a
similar way.  So once you understand how these operators work on a List
class, you'll understand how they work on other collection classes.

When a List operator contains a colon char (:), it means the operand closest
to the colon char (:) must evaluate to a List, which means the following.

   * When the left-most char in a List operator is a colon (:), the operand
     immediately to the left of the operator must evaluate to a List.
   * When the right-most char in a List operator is a colon (:), the operand
     immediately to the right of the operator must evaluate to a List.

The following ___ List operators (which are actually methods) work on the
Scala 3 List class.

1) ::  (Construct a List.  Often called the "cons" operator.)

2) ::: (Concatenate two Lists.)

3) ++  (Concatenate two Lists.)
       This operator concatenates any two Scala classe that are of type Seq.
       It works with many other Scala collections, including the List class.
