LIST OPERATORS
==============

All Scala operators are actually Scala methods.  Many of the operators
that work on the Scala List class also work on other Scala collections
(i.e, Vectors, ArrayBuffers, ListBuffers, etc.) in a similar way.  Once
you understand how these operators work on a List class, you'll understand
how they work on other collection classes.

When a List operator contains a colon char (:), it means the operand closest
to the colon char (:) must evaluate to a List, which means the following.

   * When the left-most char in a List operator is a colon (:), the operand
     immediately to the left of the operator must evaluate to a List.

   * When the right-most char in a List operator is a colon (:), the operand
     immediately to the right of the operator must evaluate to a List.

   WARNING: This rule doesn't apply to the :: operator.  When the :: operator
            is used to generate a List, the operand left must be a
            a value; the operand to its right must be a List.

The following ___ List operators work on the Scala 3 List class.

1) ::  Constructs a List.  Often called the "cons" operator.  Use it to
       prepend one or more values to a List.  The last operand in the
       line of code must evaluate to a List; all other operands must
       evaluate to a value.

       @main def main():Unit =
         var intList:List[Int] = 333 :: List(444, 555)
         println(s"intList = $intList")  // PRINTS: intList = List(333, 444, 555)
         intList = 111 :: 222 :: intList // intList
         println(s"intList = $intList")  // PRINTS: intList = List(111, 222, 333, 444, 555)
       end main

2) :::  Concatenates two Lists.  See code example in 3) below.

3) ++   Concatenates two Lists.
        This operator concatenates two Scala classes of the same type that are
        also of type Seq.  Therefore, it works with many Scala collections,
        including the List class.

        @main def main():Unit =
          var intList:List[Int] = List(333, 444)
          intList = intList ::: List(555, 666)
          println(s"intList = $intList")  // PRINTS: intList = List(333, 444, 555, 666)
          intList = List(111, 222) ++ intList
          println(s"intList = $intList")  // PRINTS: intList = List(111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666)
        end main


4) +:	  Prepends a single element to the beginning of a List. The element must
        be on the left side of the operator, the List on the right side.

5) :+	  Appends a single element to the end of a List.  The element must be
        on the right side of the operator, the List on the left side.  This
        is an O(n) operation, so it should be avoided for use on large lists.
