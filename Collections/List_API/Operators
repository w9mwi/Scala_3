LIST OPERATORS
==============

All Scala operators are actually Scala methods.  Many of the operators
that work on the Scala List class also work on other Scala collections
(i.e, Vectors, ArrayBuffers, ListBuffers, etc.) in a similar way.  Once
you understand how these operators work on a List class, you'll understand
how they work on other collection classes.

The following five List operators work on the Scala 3 List class.

1) ::   Constructs a List.  Often called the "cons" operator.  Use it to
        prepend one or more values to a List.  The last operand in the
        line of code must evaluate to a List; all other operands must
        evaluate to a value.

        @main def main():Unit =
          var intList:List[Int] = 333 :: List(444, 555)
          println(s"intList = $intList")  // PRINTS: intList = List(333, 444, 555)
          intList = 111 :: 222 :: intList
          println(s"intList = $intList")  // PRINTS: intList = List(111, 222, 333, 444, 555)
        end main

2) :::  Concatenates two Lists.  See code example in 3) below.

3) ++   Concatenates two Lists.
        This operator concatenates two Scala classes of the same type that are
        also of type Seq.  Therefore, it works with many Scala collections,
        including the List class.

        @main def main():Unit =
          var intList:List[Int] = List(333, 444)
          intList = intList ::: List(555, 666)
          println(s"intList = $intList")  // PRINTS: intList = List(333, 444, 555, 666)
          intList = List(111, 222) ++ intList
          println(s"intList = $intList")  // PRINTS: intList = List(111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666)
        end main


4) +:	  Prepends one or more elements to a List.  The last operand in the
        line of code must evaluate to a List; all other operands must
        evaluate to a value.  NOTICE: The +: and :: operators can be used
        interchangeably, as they return the same result.

        @main def main():Unit =
          var intList:List[Int] = List(444, 555)
          intList = 333 +: intList
          println(s"intList = $intList") // PRINTS: intList = List(333, 444, 555, 666)
          intList = 111 +: 222 +: intList
          println(s"intList = $intList") // PRINTS: intList = List(111, 222, 333, 444, 555)
        end main

5) :+	  Appends a single element to the end of a List.  The element must be
        on the right side of the operator, the List on the left side.  This
        is an O(n) operation, so it should be avoided for use on large lists.
