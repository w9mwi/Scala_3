SCALA COLLECTIONS
=================

Thare are three main categories of Scala Collections:

1) Sequences - A sequential collection of elements that may be indexed (like an array)
               or may be linear (like a linked list).

2) Maps - A collection of key/value pairs.  In the following example, keypadMap maps
          each number on a phone to a String to its corresponding alphabet characters.
          NOTE: Phone digits 0 and 1 don't map to any alphabet charaters on a phone,
          so they're mapped to a single-character String.

          val keypadMap = Map('0' -> "0",   '1' -> "1",   '2' -> "ABC",  '3' -> "DEF", '4' -> "GHI",
                              '5' -> "JKL", '6' -> "MNO", '7' -> "PQRS", '8' -> "TUV", '9' -> "WXYZ")

3) Sets - An unordered collection of unique values.  Duplicate values aren't
          allowed in a Set, as is demonstrated in the following program.

          @main def main():Unit =
            var colors: Set[String] = Set("Red", "Green", "Blue")
            colors.foreach(println) // PRINTS: Red
                                    //         Green
                                    //         Blue

            // NOTE: All values in a Scala Set are unique.  The following
            //       code attempts to add two elements having the identical
            //       value "Red" to the colors Set.  Printing the contents
            //       of the colors Set reveals that Scala rejected the
            //       attempt to add a duplicate "Red" value.
            colors = Set("Red", "Green", "Blue", "Red", "Yellow")
            colors.foreach(println)  // PRINTS: Red
                                     //         Green
                                     //         Blue
                                     //         Yellow
end main
