Recall that a Scala class/object is used to represent a thing,
such as a person, automobile, animal, etc.  A Scala trait is
used to represent a behavior.  Examples of a behavior
are: speak, travel, bake, etc.


A Scala method can be defined as a concrete method (which is
most common), or as an abstract method.  Here's are examples:

// The following method is a concrete method because its behavior
// is defined.  (It contains a body of executable code.)
def stop():Unit = println("Stopped walking")

// The following method is an abstract method because its behavior
// isn't defined.  (It contains no body of executable code.)  We
// know this is a method (and not a field) because it specifies
// a return type
def stop():Unit


// The following field is a concrete field because it's initialized to a value.
def weight = 123.456D

// The following field is an abstract field because it isn't initialized.
def weight



// The following method is an abstract method because its behavior
// isn't defined.  (It contains no body of executable code.)
def stop():Unit


with a body of code,
or without

A method that is defined, but contains no body/behavior/code, is
"abstract".

A Scala val can be defined these two ways:

val weight = 234
def weight = 234

using the "def" keyword.

but not initialized.  field that is defined, but isn't initialized, is
also "abstract".  (A "field" is a Scala val.  But when an abstract
field is defined, it doesn't contain the val keyword!)

Methods that contain body/behavior/code in their definition are
"concrete" methods.  Fields (vals/ vars) that are initialized to
some value "concrete" fields.




Scala traits are mostly used to hold vals/vars, methods, or
types that are abstract (undefined).  However, a Scala trait
CAN contain vals/vars, methods, and types that are defined,
as this example shows...
