ABSTRACT CLASS
==============
Unlike a regular Scala class, an abstract class can't be instantiated.  An
abstract class can only be used by a regular class that inherits from it.

FYI:  When class A inherits from class B, class A is the superclass;
      class B is the subclass.

A Scala class can be written as an abstract class when the "abstract" keyword
precedes the "class" keyword.  It must also contain at least one method that's
not implemented, or at least one val/var member that's not initialized.  The
program below demonstrates this.

NOTE: The behavior of the following program remains unchanged if you
      replace this line of text:  abstract class Animal:
      with this line of text:     trait Animal:

The section below explains the similarities and differences between an
abstract class and a trait.
======================================================================
@main def main():Unit =
  val dog = IrishSetter("Big Red")
  println(s"dog = $dog")
  // PRINTS:  dog = This Irish Setter is named Big Red; it's 12 years old.
end main

abstract class Animal:
  def ageInYears:Int // ageInYears is an abstract method.
  val bodyTemp:Int   // bodyTemp is an abstract member.

// The following IrishSetter class inherits from the Animal class by
// implementing the "extends" keyword.  This class wouldn't compile
// if it didn't initialize bodyTemp to some value, or if it didn't
// implement the ageInYears method.
class IrishSetter(name: String) extends Animal:
  val bodyTemp = 93
  def ageInYears = 12
  // Every class has a default toString() method.  Here we override that
  // method with our own toString definition so it prints relevant info.
  override def toString = s"This Irish Setter is named $name; it's $ageInYears years old."

TRAIT VS. ABSTRACT CLASS
========================
As mentioned above, a Scala trait (like an abstract class) can also contain
abstract methods and abstract members.  A trait containing an abstract method,
or an abstract member, can then be inherited by another trait.

So when you want to write a class that implements abstract methods/members, you can write
either an abstract class, or a trait, to contain those abstract methods/members.  So then
your class can inherit from either the trait you wrote, or inherit from the abstract class
you wrote.

QUESTION: When you need to write abstract methods/members, should they
          be contained in a trait, or in an abstract class?

ANSWER:   Scala 2 traits can't accept arguments, but abstract classes (in both Scala 2
          and Scala 3) can accept arguments.  So Scala 2 required you to use an abstract
          class instead of a trait, if it required arguments.  Since Scala 3 traits now
          accept arguments, it's recommended that you use a trait to hold abstract
          methods/members, instead of an abstract class.  Then, inherit that trait
          from a regular class.

IMPORTANT:  A class can inherit from only one class, and from any number of traits.
            Generally, you should use a trait to hold methods and members that can
            apply to different class types.  For example, assume you have 3 classes named
            Boat, Car, and Jet; and all 3 of those classes implemented methods named
            startEngine(), travel(), and stopEngine().  You could place those 3 methods
            in a trait named Action, where you'd define each one as either an abstract
            method, or a concrete method.  Finally, the Boat, Car, and Jet classes
            would all inherit from that Action trait.
